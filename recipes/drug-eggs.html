    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Korean Marinated "Drug Eggs" are a favorite in our household because of the tasty marinade and the jammy center of the soft-boiled egg. Fortunately, they are incredibly easy and quick to make - the longest part is the wait for the eggs to marinade!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 scallion, chopped finely</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Korean Red Pepper Flakes, also known as Gochugaru</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1-2 thai chilis</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>3-4 cloves minced garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a medium to large pot 2/3 of the way up with water and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Gently place 6 eggs into the water and boil for 7 minutes. For a more cooked center, boil for a few minutes longer.</li>
        <li>While the eggs are boiling, combine remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs have finished boiling, take them out of the boiling water and put them in a large bowl filled with ice water.</li>
        <li>Peel the boiled eggs, and place them in the marinade.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with eggs and marinade and refrigerate for at least 6 hours before enjoying.</li>
    </ol>
