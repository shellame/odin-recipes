    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This was a favorite childhood dish of mine growing up. Whenever we had "culture days" at school, I would ask my mom to make this dish, but she always refused, saying that it wouldn't be to American taste. I love making this with ripe heirloom tomatoes during the peak of their summer season. Depending on the flavor of the tomatoes, you may not need to add sugar at all!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2-3 ripe tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Xiaoxing wine (optional)</li>
        <li>1-2 Tablespoons sugar</li>
    </ul>
