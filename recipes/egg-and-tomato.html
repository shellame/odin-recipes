    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="para">This was a favorite childhood dish of mine growing up. Whenever we had "culture days" at school, I would ask my mom to make this dish, but she always refused, saying that it wouldn't be to American taste. I love making this with ripe heirloom tomatoes during the peak of their summer season. Depending on the flavor of the tomatoes, you may not need to add sugar at all!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="bullets">
        <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <Li>Salt and Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2-3 ripe tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Shaoxing wine (optional)</li>
        <li>1-2 Tablespoons sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up 2 tablespoons neutral oil in a large frying pan or wok.</li>
        <li>Scramble four large eggs in a separate bowl with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the scrambled eggs into the pan or wok. Let the eggs set before stirring and scrambling them. Once all of the eggs are mostly set, remove them from the pan into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, soy sauce, optional shaoxing wine, and sugar to the pan. Cook on medium heat until the tomatoes are soft and have released their liquid.</li>
        <li>Add the scrambled eggs back to the tomato mixture, and break up the eggs into small bite sized pieces and stir. Continue to cook on medium low heat until the tomato juices have been incorporated into the eggs.</li>
    </ol>
